Will Blue Dot Network partner countries only work with Blue Dot certified projects?
Blue Dot Network partner countries can work with any projects that meet their needs and national interests. Partner countries have committed to upholding quality infrastructure standards and may prefer Blue Dot Network certified projects, but at times those projects may not meet the needs of the country.
How can the Blue Dot Network help address the climate crisis and advance the Paris Agreement?
Blue Dot Network will play a critical role in mobilizing and aligning infrastructure investment into projects that build resilience to climate change and are aligned with the pathways towards 2050 net-zero emissions needed to keep global temperature change of 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach. By taking a longer-term investment perspective and incorporating costs and benefits accrued over the entire infrastructure lifecycle, the Blue Dot Network will help host countries and investors realize the financial, economic, environmental, and social benefits of climate-smart infrastructure compared to alternatives that may appear cheaper in terms of up-front cost.
